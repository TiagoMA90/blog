# Digital Nomads
- Digital Nomads is a website that allows developers to share their experiences outside the office.
- No desks, no cubicles, no offices.
- It is a platform for nomads in the digital world to share their personal adventures, tips and recommendations when working and exploring the world.

# Live Project
- The live website can be found [here](https://digital-nomad.herokuapp.com/).

# Purpose of the website:
- To provide a platform where users can share their stories as digital nomads.
- To promote the idea that developers can be flexible on the job while working and traveling.
- To create a community and connect users in a "guild" of like-minded people.
- To allow users to share their ideas and help each other both in front and behind the screen.

# Design:
The website was designed with the intent to allow users to browse posts easily and perform all CRUD functionalities. It relied on colors that should be appealing to the user, especially for those who might use the website on a daily basis.

For such, it makes use of a color palette of a mere greenish, brownish, and yellowish blend (COLOR # HERE) for the navigation bar. This gives a rustic feeling and is often associated with the nomadic camper life at the beach, desert, and mountain.

The background is best defined by a grayish white (COLOR # HERE), and the body of the post has a lighter gray (COLOR # HERE), bordered by dashed lines. The buttons in the post borrow the same patterns and render a shadow beneath them to contrast the body. This gives the illusion that the user is writing a post on a piece of paper/document.

[IMG for COLOR PALETTE]

For a website where its functionality consists of writing and reading articles, the fonts used for this website were "Audiowide" and "Staatliches." A choice that should appeal to a user's readability and block them from distractions of a complex design. The fonts and logo on the navigation bar are dyed in white, while the body presents itself with a dark grayish tone that doesn't stand too much from the article. Links in the navigation bar are highlighted by a white tone when hovered, and bold when active. Links change color upon hover, particularly the title of the post, the username in a post/comment, the social media links, and links that redirect to other pages.

Icons were also integrated into the website to give a much more aesthetic touch and association of functionality of the website. The navigation bar, footer, and pages in the body make use of icons. The logo states "Digital Nomads" and is animated by an icon to give the idea that devs are on the move. Red was the chosen color to highlight it from the rest of the name. Both the header and footer have an image attached to them, of somebody networking, to give the impression that they are typing and reading posts. Hence the screen at the top and the hand at the bottom.

The structure of the website is coherent, and the base.html is present on all pages. The skeleton of the body is consistent for all pages.

## Planning & Agile:
This project was planned using Agile methodology and MoSCoW prioritization.
For this purpose, the project was illustrated by one milestone titled "Submit the project to CI before Deadline," providing the developer with the freedom to accomplish all issues/tasks flexibly by the deadline.
Throughout the development process, new issues were added/removed, starting from "Todo," progressing to "In Progress," and finally being finalized in "Done."
The issues were assigned to the sole developer, [TiagoMA90](https://github.com/TiagoMA90), and labeled as "could-have," "should-have," and "must-have."
Once completed, the issues were marked as "done," and when all of them were completed, the milestone was closed.

## Development Process
The project started out as a forum for Ads of Events, where users could post events taking place at a certain time in a certain location.
Users would open up a thread, give a brief description of the event, target the location with Google Maps API, and set the date. After an event took place, it would be automatically deleted.

In the end, this project was simplified due to deadline limitations and time constraints. It makes good use of familiar concepts such as Create Read Update Delete.
Upon re-creating this project, the developer rethought the idea of a "forum" or "discussion board," similar to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), but more focused on the nomadic lifestyle.

## Manual Testing and Website Functionality:

Manual testing has been performed for its overall purpose.
The website has proven to exhibit dynamic functionality and responsive interactivity, both in the Front & Back-End.
After consecutive rehearsals and manual testing, the website employed the desired role and met the final goal set by the developer.

Based on the solid foundations of CRUD, testing was performed:
- By navigating and accessing links on the website.
- By Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting an account for a registered user.
- By Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting posts as a registered user.
- By Creating and Reading comments on a post as a registered user.
- By Liking and Disliking a post as a registered user.
- By Populating the homepage with posts to activate Pagination.
- By inputting and retrieving results from the search box.
- By Resetting the password of an account via email.
- By manipulating posts, users, comments, and likes as a superuser in the Admin panel.

By clicking the links in the navigation panel, users are redirected to the assigned pages.
- By clicking on "Home," users are sent to the homepage, where the board of posts can be found. From here, users can browse posts and select one to read.
- By clicking on "About," users are sent to the About page. Within that page, users can read the introduction and the mission goal of the website. Users may navigate to the Registration and Login pages.
- By clicking on "Post," users are redirected to the Post Form, where they must input a title and body to create a thread. Posts are submitted by clicking the Submit Button. (Users must be logged in to post; otherwise, they are prompted to the Login page.)
- Once a post has been successfully created, it can be accessed and read by the entire community.
- Authors of that particular thread can Edit, Delete, Like/Dislike, and Comment on that post. Respectively, these functionalities are achieved by clicking the following icons at the end of the thread: the "Pencil," "Bin," "Heart," and the "Add Comment" links.
- Other users can Like/Dislike and/or Comment on that post by clicking the same icons mentioned above.
- Comments cannot be updated or deleted by anyone once submitted, except by administrators. To submit a comment on the Comment page, users must click the "Submit Comment" button.
- By clicking on "Profile," users are sent to the

Bugs and Excluded features:
- The ckeditor failed to render properly in the body of the Post. Eventually ckeditor was removed from the project altogether, give Users the possibility to write a basic TextField.

[SCREENSHOTS] (ELABORATE)

- This website was developed on Gitpod hosted by GitHub, making use of both Front-end and Back-end.

Errors and Removed functionalities:
- ckeditor - (traces of the code are still visible in the code) - Had trouble with assets such as "brown-paper" & others.
- Imported and uploaded manually, but the interface was unrecognizable. Eventually moved back to models.TextField()

Languages
- HTML (markup language)
- CSS (style sheet language)
- Python (programming language)

Frameworks
- Bootsrap (css framework)
- Django (web framework)
